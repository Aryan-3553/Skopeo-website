Awesome—here’s a **copy-paste prompt for Vercel v0** to generate Skopeo’s full website. It’s opinionated (modern, enterprise, “Harvey/Endex” vibe), production-ready stack, and includes pages, components, content, and brand system.

# Prompt for v0

**Build a production-grade marketing website for “Skopeo” — an AI-native, open-source, self-hosted spreadsheet engine.**
Target vibe: *sleek, enterprise, high-contrast, subtle motion; trust-first; modern grid/AI aesthetic (inspired by legal/fintech sites).*

### Tech & Architecture

* Framework: **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript**
* Styling: **Tailwind CSS** with tokens + CSS variables, **dark/light themes**
* UI kit: **shadcn/ui** (Radix under the hood); compose sections with Cards, Tabs, Accordion, Dialog, Tooltip
* Motion: **Framer Motion** for tasteful micro-interactions (fade/scale/reveal on scroll, parallax hero, subtle hover)
* Content: **MDX** for “Blog”, “Docs”, and “Changelog”
* SEO: per-page metadata, dynamic **OG image** route, sitemap.xml, robots.txt
* Analytics: add stubs for **Vercel Analytics**; env flags for PostHog/GA
* A11y & Perf: focus states, color-contrast, keyboard nav; ship ≥90 Lighthouse

### Brand System

* **Typography:** Inter (UI), Sora or Space Grotesk (headlines)
* **Palette:**

  * Base: near-black `#0A0F1F`, off-white `#F6F8FB`
  * Primary: Deep Azure `#1D4ED8`
  * Accent: Emerald `#10B981`
  * Muted: Slate `#64748B`
* **Visual motif:** soft **grid/cell** backgrounds, animated “aurora” gradients, thin hairline dividers, glassy cards
* **Iconography:** outline icons hinting **grid, lineage, shield, spark/agent**

### Sitemap (routes & sections)

1. **/** (Home)

   * Sticky Nav (Logo, Product, Features, Docs, Pricing, Blog, Security, Contact, “Try the Demo”)
   * **Hero**: concise value prop, two primary CTAs (“Try Demo”, “Book a Call”), secondary CTA (“View Docs”); animated grid background; mini code/formula block that types a formula and explanation
   * **Trust bar**: placeholder logos (toggleable)
   * **Problem → Solution**: 3 blockers (wrangling, debugging, documenting) -> inline chips; solution cards with screenshots
   * **Product Highlights** (5 pillars): Conversational UI • Multimodal • Model Choice • Context-Aware • Personalization
   * **Use cases**: Finance Ops, Manufacturing, Public Sector (cards with micro-charts)
   * **Security & Self-hosting**: SSO, on-prem/VPC, audit logs, data residency; link to Security page
   * **Pricing preview** (3 tiers) with CTA to /pricing
   * **Testimonials** slider (placeholder quotes)
   * **CTA band**: “Make the spreadsheet think with you” + buttons
   * Footer (product, company, resources, legal, socials)
2. **/product**

   * Deep dive: **inside-the-grid AI**; **cell-level provenance/tests/rollback**; **WOPI/Collabora** foundation; annotated screenshots (placeholders)
   * Tabs: Formulas, Pivots/Charts, ETL Lite, Lineage/Tests, Admin/SSO
3. **/features**

   * Feature cards for: Conversational in-grid UI; Multimodal handling; **Model Choice (OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepSeek/xAI)**; Context-aware assistance; Personalization (Guided/Power modes); Enterprise controls
   * Each card: short copy + mini demo/gif placeholder + “Learn more” anchor
4. **/pricing**

   * Cards: Community (open-source), Team, Enterprise (SSO, on-prem support, SLAs, audit, priority features)
   * FAQ (Accordion), contact sales button
5. **/security**

   * Self-hosting & VPC posture; data residency; SSO/SAML/OIDC; audit logs; permissions; encryption; compliance roadmap; responsible AI notes
6. **/docs** (MDX)

   * Sidebar nav; pages: Getting Started, Self-host (Docker/Helm), Connectors, AI Settings (model selection policies), Formulas & AI, ETL Lite, Admin Guide
7. **/blog** (MDX) + **/changelog** (MDX)
8. **/contact**

   * Form (name, email, role, company, message); server action stub; success state
9. **/demo**

   * Safe, non-functional **interactive mock**: spreadsheet grid hero with animated “type-ahead” example (e.g., “normalize sales by month and build a pivot with slicer”) producing a faux result + provenance panel
10. **/careers**, **/legal/privacy**, **/legal/terms**, **/404**

### Copy (initial content to prefill)

* **Tagline:** “The self-hosted, AI-native spreadsheet that thinks like an analyst.”
* **Subhead:** “Put AI inside the grid. Author formulas, reshape data, build pivots/charts, and verify outputs — with cell-level provenance, tests, and rollback.”
* **Problem bullets:**

  * Wrangling CSVs/APIs/DBs is brittle in the grid
  * Debugging nested/dynamic formulas without lineage is guesswork
  * Documenting every step is manual and outdated
* **Solution pillars:**

  * **Conversational, in-grid UI:** Ask on a selected range; get formulas, pivots, or charts plus explanations and quick tests
  * **Multimodal data handling:** Tables, text, images, files (CSV/JSON/DB), replayable steps, spill-safe views for >grid data
  * **Model choice (multi-LLM):** Pick OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, xAI’s Grok per task/sheet/workspace; policy-driven routing
  * **Context-aware assistance:** Uses selection, headers, history, and prior steps; clickable lineage to source ranges
  * **Personalization:** Guided Mode (guardrails, one-click tests) • Power Mode (inline editor, hints, “why this works” trace)
* **Why self-hosted:** privacy, control, extensibility, predictable cost
* **Vision snippet:** “By 2030, spreadsheets won’t be static grids — they’ll be intelligent collaborators. Skopeo is the engine making that real, today.”

### Components to generate

* `<SiteHeader />` with sticky behavior, mobile sheet menu, theme toggle
* `<Hero />` with animated grid/aurora background + typewriter formula demo
* `<LogoCloud />`, `<FeatureCard />`, `<PricingTable />`, `<FAQ />`, `<TestimonialCarousel />`
* `<SecurityHighlights />`, `<CTASection />`, `<Footer />`
* `<ProvenancePanel />` mock (title, inputs, prompt, output, tests)
* **MDX** blog/docs/changelog layout with sidebar and TOC
* **OG image generator** route (api/og) with logo, title, gradient
* **Form action** (contact) with server validation & thank-you state

### Content & Configuration

* Put site meta in `config/site.ts`: name, tagline, nav, footer links, social links
* Put theme tokens in `styles/tokens.css`; support dark/light
* Use `next-seo`-style metadata or Next Metadata API per route
* Add `.env` stubs: `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` (optional)

### Interaction & Motion (tasteful, minimal)

* On scroll: staggered fade-up for feature cards; hero background slow parallax
* On hover: card lift by 2–4px, subtle shadow; CTA ripple
* Reduced-motion respect via `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Performance & A11y

* Use `next/image`; lazy-load heavy media; prefetch critical routes
* Keyboard focus rings; aria-labels; sufficient contrast; semantic headings

### Deliverables

* A complete Next.js codebase with the pages above, **real copy prefilled** from this brief, and placeholder images/demos
* Ready to deploy on Vercel; include README with “How to run locally” and “How to edit MDX”
* Keep all text/content editable and stored as MDX or config so non-devs can iterate

**Build now.**

## (Optional) Notes / references used for style & capabilities (not part of the prompt)

* v0 builds full apps from natural-language prompts and can fix/debug + deploy with Vercel. ([v0.app][1])
* shadcn/ui components are editable and openable in v0 for customization. ([ui.shadcn.com][2])
* **Harvey.ai** site vibe: Assistant, Vault, Knowledge, Workflows, Word Add-In; enterprise posture & trust styling. ([Harvey][3])
* **Endex** site vibe: Excel-native agent, auditable outputs/citations, finance-forward design; recent funding. ([Endex][4])

If you want, I can generate **alternate prompts** (e.g., darker fintech look vs. brighter devtools look) or a **one-pager version** for quick v0 experiments.
